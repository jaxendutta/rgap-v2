# Bookmarks

Bookmarks allow you to curate your own collections of grants and researchers.

## How to Bookmark

Look for the **Bookmark Icon** (a ribbon shape) on any card in the search results or on a profile page.
* **Empty Icon:** Not bookmarked.
* **Filled Icon:** Saved to your library.

## Managing Bookmarks

Navigate to the **Bookmarks** tab in the sidebar. Here you can:
1. View all your saved items.
2. **Add Notes:** You can add private notes to any bookmark (e.g., *"Potential supervisor for PhD"* or *"Apply for this next year"*).
3. **Remove:** Click the icon again to remove the item from your list.

> **Privacy:** Your bookmarks and notes are private. They are visible only to you when you are logged in.
