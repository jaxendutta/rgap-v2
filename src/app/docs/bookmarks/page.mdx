# Bookmarks

Bookmarks are your personal curation tool. You can bookmark almost anything in RGAP: a specific Grant, a Researcher, or a University.

## How to use Bookmarks

Look for the **Ribbon Icon** on cards and profiles. It looks like this:

<div className="my-6 flex items-center gap-6 p-4 bg-gray-50 rounded-xl border border-gray-100 w-fit">
    <div className="flex flex-col items-center gap-2">
        <div className="p-3 bg-white rounded-full shadow-sm border border-gray-200">
            <LuBookmark className="w-6 h-6 text-gray-400" />
        </div>
        <span className="text-xs text-gray-500 font-mono">Unsaved</span>
    </div>
    <div className="text-gray-300">→</div>
    <div className="flex flex-col items-center gap-2">
        <div className="p-3 bg-white rounded-full shadow-sm border border-gray-200">
            <LuBookmark className="w-6 h-6 text-gray-900 fill-gray-900" />
        </div>
        <span className="text-xs text-gray-900 font-mono font-bold">Saved</span>
    </div>
</div>

* **Click to Save:** The icon turns solid black. The item is now in your library.
* **Click to Remove:** The icon reverts to an outline. The item is removed.

## Adding Notes

The most powerful feature of bookmarks is the ability to add context. 

1.  Go to your **Bookmarks Dashboard** via the sidebar.
2.  Find the item you saved.
3.  Click **"Add Note"**.

This is useful for teams or students who are scouting for opportunities. You can write notes like *"Application deadline is Nov 1st"* or *"This researcher's work aligns with our Q3 goals."*
