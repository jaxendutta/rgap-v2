# Search & Filters

The search engine is the core of the platform. Unlike general search bars, ours is split into three specific modes to give you precise results.

## Search Modes

Choose the mode that matches your intent:

1.  **Grant Keyword:** Searches the English title of the project. Use this for topics like "Machine Learning" or "Climate Change".
2.  **Recipient:** Finds grants awarded to a specific person or organization. Enter the legal name of the researcher.
3.  **Institution:** Finds grants administered by a specific university or research center.

## Filtering Results

Filters help you cut through the noise. The filter panel appears on the left side of your results.

### Date Range
Filter by the **Agreement Start Date**. This is useful if you only want to see active research from the last 5 years.

### Value Range
Filter by the total award amount. Setting a minimum value (e.g., `$50,000`) is the best way to filter out small travel grants and focus on major research projects.

<Alert type="tip" title="Pro Tip">
    Combining filters is powerful. Try searching for **"AI"** while filtering for **NSERC** grants over **$100k**. This gives you a clear view of major engineering funding in that sector.
