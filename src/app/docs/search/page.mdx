# Search & Filters

The search interface allows you to query the grant database using specific parameters.

## Search Modes

The search bar is divided into three distinct fields. You must use the correct field for your query:

1.  **Grant Keyword:** Searches the *Title* of the grant in English.
    * *Example:* Searching `Machine Learning` will find grants with "Machine Learning" explicitly in the title.
2.  **Recipient:** Searches for the Legal Name of the researcher or organization.
3.  **Institution:** Searches for the university or research center name.

## Using Filters

Once you have initial results, use the filter panel to narrow them down.

### Date Range
You can filter grants by their **Agreement Start Date**.
* **From:** Grants that started on or after this date.
* **To:** Grants that started on or before this date.

### Value Range
Filter by the total award amount.
* *Example:* Set `Min: 100000` to find major research projects worth over $100k.

### Agency & Location
* **Agencies:** Toggle specific agencies (e.g., NSERC only).
* **Location:** Filter by Province (e.g., Ontario) or City.
