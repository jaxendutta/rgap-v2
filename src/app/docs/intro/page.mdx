# Introduction

The Research Grant Analytics Platform (RGAP) democratizes access to Canadian research funding data. We aggregate official government records to help students, researchers, and administrators discover funding trends without needing to navigate complex government portals.

## Data Sources

We source our data directly from the [**Open Government Portal**](https://search.open.canada.ca/grants/). It is updated annually to reflect the latest fiscal year awards.

* [**NSERC** (Natural Sciences and Engineering)](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/index_eng.asp)
* [**SSHRC** (Social Sciences and Humanities)](https://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/home-accueil-eng.aspx)
* [**CIHR** (Canadian Institutes of Health Research)](https://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/193.html)

<Alert type="note" title="Data Lag">
    Because we rely on official finalized datasets, there is typically a 6-12 month lag between a grant being awarded and it appearing in the public record.

## Core Capabilities

RGAP is designed around three main workflows:

1.  **Discovery:** Find grants using broad keywords or specific identifiers.
2.  **Analysis:** Visualize funding history for any university or researcher in Canada.
3.  **Curation:** Build personal lists of grants and add private notes for your own research.
