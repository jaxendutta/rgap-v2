# Introduction

The Research Grant Analytics Platform (RGAP) democratizes access to Canadian research funding data, making it easier to discover trends and opportunities.

## Data Sources

We aggregate data from the three primary federal granting agencies. This data is sourced directly from the Open Government Portal.

* [**NSERC** (Natural Sciences and Engineering)](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/)
* [**SSHRC** (Social Sciences and Humanities)](https://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/)
* [**CIHR** (Canadian Institutes of Health Research)](https://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/)

> **Note:** Because we rely on official datasets, there is typically a lag between a grant being awarded and it appearing in the public record.

## How it Works

RGAP allows you to search the database using three specific criteria:
1.  **Grant Title:** Finds projects where the title contains your keyword.
2.  **Recipient:** Finds grants awarded to specific researchers or organizations.
3.  **Institution:** Finds grants administered by a specific university or center.
