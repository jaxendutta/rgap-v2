# Account & Security

RGAP is free to browse. You do not need an account to search for grants or view analytics. However, creating an account unlocks your **Personal Workspace**.

## Why Register?

Without an account, your session is temporary. If you close your browser, your work is lost. An account gives you:

* **Persistent Bookmarks:** Save grants and profiles to your library.
* **Private Notes:** Attach comments to any bookmark (e.g., "Review this for Q3 application").
* **Search History:** Quickly jump back to previous queries.

## Privacy Standards

We believe research data is sensitive. We have built our security model to ensure your activity remains private.

1.  **Passwords:** We use industry-standard `bcrypt` encryption. We never see your raw password.
2.  **Data Isolation:** Your search history and notes are visible only to you. We do not sell user activity data.
3.  **Right to Delete:** You can permanently delete your account and all associated data at any time from the Settings page.
