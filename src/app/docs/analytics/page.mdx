## Available Metrics

### Funding Trend (10-Year)

* **Growth:** Is the institution attracting more funding over time?
* **Gaps:** Were there years with significant drops in funding?

### Agency Distribution
This pie chart breaks down the funding source. For a university, this helps visualize their research focus.
* A high **CIHR** percentage indicates a strong Medical/Health faculty.
