# Analytics Engine

Every profile on RGAP includes an automated analytics dashboard. We generate these charts in real-time using the entity's entire funding history.

## Reading the Charts

### 1. Funding Trends over 2010 - 2026
This line chart displays the **Total Awarded Amount** per fiscal year.

* **Peaks:** Usually indicate a major multi-year grant was awarded (like a Partnership Grant).
* **Valleys:** Often happen between grant renewal cycles.

### 2. Agency Distribution
This pie chart breaks down funding by source (NSERC, SSHRC, CIHR). This is a quick way to identify an institution's specialization. A university with 80% CIHR funding is likely a medical-focused institution.

<Alert type="caution" title="Agreement Values">
    The dollar amounts shown are **Agreement Values**. This is the amount the government committed at the start of the project. It may not reflect partial payouts or funds returned if a project was cancelled early.
